Slack doesn't unfurl links that already got posted previously
Will need to implement the status code response like 404 if sub is not found or command crashes
We maywant to update the message body object text property for new/top/controversial/rising
Search can't be empty, if no text after reddit-q or reddit-s-q, send an ephemeral response: "you must enter a search query + usage"

implement list command: reddit-l and reddit-s-l, hot default
can add new/top/rising/controversial      and    subreddit new/top/rising/controversial
